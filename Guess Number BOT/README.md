# Discord Bot Setup
To get a bot token go to Discord Developer Portal, create a new application and add a bot.

# Still working on the bot, but feel free to fork and pull request.

Check out the `guess_number.py` file.  Two things you need is IDE for python interpreter and bot token from Discord Developer Portal.  

`What is this?` Play the game with the bot to guess the right number within "n" rounds or you lose.

`.n` - This command will be used to enter the number to guess.  
`.bound` - Between 1 and 10 is default.  This command be used if you'd like to set the bound.
`.ping` - Show bot's latency and display `.start` and `.use`
