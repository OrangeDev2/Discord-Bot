# Discord Bot Setup
To get a bot token go to Discord Developer Portal, create a new application and add a bot.

# Still working on the bot, but feel free to fork and pull request.

Check out the `guess_number.py` file.  Two things you need is IDE for python interpreter (You might have to install a few things.  Look what I used to import below.) and bot token from Discord Developer Portal.  

`What is this?` Play the game with the bot to guess the right number within "n" rounds or you lose.


Commands:


`.help` - Consists of all commands.

`.start` - Start a game.  

`.guess` - This command will be used to enter the number to guess.  

`.bound` - Between 1 and 10 is default.  This command be used if you'd like to set the bound.

`.use` (similar to help)

Code (Python):
The code use import `discord, math, random, discord.exe.commands`

Feel free to comment.
